# Hello World

Welcome to my dev notes! This is the first post on my blog, and I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts on frontend development.

## Why Dev Notes?

I've always found that writing about what I learn helps me understand things more deeply. This blog will be a place where I document:

- **Tutorials** — Step-by-step guides on tools and techniques I use daily
- **Thoughts** — Opinions on the frontend ecosystem and best practices
- **TIL** — Short "Today I Learned" posts about interesting discoveries

## What to Expect

I'll mostly be writing about:

- React and Next.js patterns
- TypeScript tips and tricks
- CSS and Tailwind techniques
- Developer tooling and workflows

## Let's Go

If you're interested in frontend development, I hope you'll find something useful here. Stay tuned for more posts!

```tsx
// Here's to clean code and great interfaces
export default function HelloWorld() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

Thanks for reading!
