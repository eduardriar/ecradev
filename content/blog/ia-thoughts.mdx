# How this site was built?

I don't feel shame to say I built this website using IA (Cursor + Claude), and I'm a frontend developer who is capable of building this kind of applications. However I think it's time to join the IA entuasiasm.  I was delaying the upgrade of my portafolio which includes some new features that I want to show and make them public, now that IA exploded I decided to experiment with this and build my new portafolio. In this post I'll document everything that I found related with IA + Development.

## How I started this project

1. I took as reference/motivation this video from Platzi (That's how to develop in 2026)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyeHZH2jeOk]
2. Install Claude + Cursor
3. Learn Claude options to discover what this tool is capable of. I enabled /plan option to start building this website
4. This was the prompt I used to start this portafolio.

## Context                                                                                                                                                   
  Build a personal portfolio website for a Frontend Developer. The site should showcase work, skills, and host a blog section called "Dev Notes". The design is
   minimal & clean with subtle scroll animations.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Blog:** MDX files (rendered at build time via `next-mdx-remote` or `@next/mdx`)
- **Animations:** Framer Motion (fade-in / slide-up on scroll)
- **Contact form:** EmailJS (no backend needed) or Resend
- **Deployment-ready:** Vercel-compatible

5. It created the whole project, (My work is at risk?)

## Findings after the IA built the site

I was really impressed about what Cursor is capable of, my first thought was "That's the Job I'm doing". But later I found things that change my mind, it may depend on how specific I was when telling the IA to do. Despite the code is very well organized and good quality, in think that as a developer of the new era we have to check and understand how this code was written, I found that there wasn't componentization at all, this is important to maintain a good structure of the problem. I found this issue when modifying the Header.tsx component, and I decided to create new components for readability.
